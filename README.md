# Romulus Face Project

## Design Evolution

### Attempt 1: 3D Bust (index.html, monument.html, bust.html)
**Problem:** Looked like cheap CGI / low-res Blender renders. Uncanny valley.  
**Lesson:** 3D realism is HARD. Without professional modeling/texturing, it looks amateur.

### Attempt 2: Simple Geometric (oracle.html)
**Problem:** Too abstract. Lost the "Roman bust" concept.  
**Lesson:** Minimal can work, but needs to serve the concept.

### Attempt 3: Basic Pixel Art (pixel-bust.html)
**Problem:** Used solid color blocks, no dithering/gradients. Looked flat and simplistic.  
**Lesson:** Pixel art requires TECHNIQUE — dithering, shading, gradients through pixel patterns.

### Current Goal: Photo-Realistic Pixel Art
**Requirements:**
- 10-15 shades for marble (smooth gradients via dithering)
- Detailed facial features (eyes, nose, beard texture)
- Ancient Roman aesthetic (laurel wreath, classical proportions)
- Professional dithering technique (checkerboard/noise patterns for transitions)
- Photo-realistic shading (like vaporwave statue aesthetics)

**References:**
- Vaporwave marble busts (detailed shading, smooth gradients)
- Professional pixel art dithering tutorials
- Classical Roman sculpture proportions

## Technical Notes

**Dithering patterns:**
- Checkerboard (50/50 mix)
- 3:1, 2:1 patterns for gradual transitions
- Noise dithering for organic surfaces (marble texture)

**Color palette (marble):**
- Pure white (highlights)
- Light gray (main light)
- Mid gray (body)
- Dark gray (shadow)
- Near-black (deep shadow)
- + intermediate dithered shades

**Eye color (emerald):**
- Bright emerald (#00ff88)
- Mid emerald (#00cc66)
- Dark emerald (#008844)
- Black pupils

*Next implementation: Professional photo-realistic pixel art with proper dithering and shading techniques.*
