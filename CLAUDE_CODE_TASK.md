# Claude Code Browser Task: Improve Romulus Face ASCII Design

**Repository:** romulus-silvius/romulus-face  
**Branch:** Create new branch: `improve-ascii-design`  
**File to update:** `ascii-bust.html`

---

## Task Description

Improve the ASCII art Roman bust design in `ascii-bust.html` with better visual quality and animations.

---

## Design Inspiration

**Reference modern ASCII art projects that feature:**
- Clean, detailed ASCII character art
- Smooth animations (typing effects, glow, breathing)
- Terminal aesthetic (monospace fonts, retro styling)
- Professional presentation

**Style goals:**
- More detailed Roman bust (sharper features, better proportions)
- Enhanced terminal aesthetic
- Smoother, more polished animations
- Maintain existing color scheme (green on black terminal theme)

---

## Current Implementation

**File:** `ascii-bust.html`

**Current features:**
- Basic Roman bust in ASCII using block characters (█ ░)
- Terminal green color (#00ff00) on black background
- Typing effect animation
- Breathing opacity effect
- Blinking cursor
- Responsive design

**Issues to address:**
- ASCII art could be more detailed and refined
- Proportions could be better (head/neck/torso)
- Could use more sophisticated character variety (not just █ ░)
- Animations could be smoother

---

## Improvements Requested

### 1. Enhanced ASCII Art

**Better character usage:**
- Use wider variety of ASCII characters for depth/shading
- Examples: `@#$%&*+=:;.,` for gradients
- Or stick with blocks but improve proportions

**Better detail:**
- More defined facial features (if front-facing)
- Clearer profile silhouette (if side view)
- Better neck and shoulder structure
- More realistic Roman emperor aesthetic

**Size optimization:**
- Keep responsive (works on mobile)
- Consider slightly larger on desktop for detail

### 2. Animation Refinement

**Keep existing:**
- ✅ Typing effect (character-by-character reveal)
- ✅ Glow effect (text-shadow pulse)
- ✅ Blinking cursor
- ✅ Breathing (opacity pulse)

**Consider adding:**
- Scanline effect (retro CRT feel)
- Slight color shift in glow (green variations)
- More subtle breathing (currently too noticeable)
- Optional: Parallax effect on scroll (if adding content)

### 3. Typography & Layout

**Current:**
- Title: "ROMULUS" with cursor
- Subtitle: "CONSIGLIERE • ENGINEER • GUARDIAN"

**Improvements:**
- Better font choices (still monospace)
- Refined letter-spacing
- Consider adding subtle Roman numerals or Latin phrase
- Better vertical rhythm

### 4. Code Quality

**Ensure:**
- Clean, commented code
- Semantic HTML
- Efficient CSS (no redundancy)
- Smooth JavaScript animations (requestAnimationFrame if needed)
- Mobile-optimized (touch-friendly, readable on small screens)

---

## Technical Requirements

**Compatibility:**
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile responsive (down to 375px width)
- No external dependencies (embedded CSS/JS only)

**Performance:**
- Fast load time
- Smooth 60fps animations
- Lightweight (<50KB total)

**Accessibility:**
- Semantic HTML structure
- Readable contrast ratios
- Screen reader friendly (where applicable)

---

## Deliverables

**Updated file:**
- `ascii-bust.html` with improved design

**Test:**
- Verify animations work smoothly
- Check mobile responsiveness
- Ensure ASCII art displays correctly

**Commit message:**
- "feat: improve ASCII bust design with enhanced detail and animations"

## Success Criteria

**Visual quality:**
- ✅ More detailed and refined ASCII art
- ✅ Better proportions and character variety
- ✅ Professional, polished appearance

**Animations:**
- ✅ Smooth, performant (no jank)
- ✅ Subtle and tasteful (not overwhelming)
- ✅ Enhance the design without distracting

**Code quality:**
- ✅ Clean, maintainable code
- ✅ Well-commented for future updates
- ✅ No console errors or warnings

**Responsiveness:**
- ✅ Works beautifully on desktop
- ✅ Scales well to mobile

## Notes

**Brand identity:**

- Theme: Ancient Rome meets modern tech
- Vibe: Dignified, powerful, timeless, intelligent

**Tone:**
- Professional but not stiff
- Classic but not outdated
